title: About Tristin
---
I am a software engineer based out of Seattle, Washington. I work on the back end, the front end, the full stack, and occasionally the short stack. I've been developing software professionally for over 10 years, and tinkering with web stuff for even longer.

**Buzzwords**: NodeJS, Golang, TypeScript, React, AWS, serverless, hypermedia, observability, scale.

**Other interests**: entrepreneurship, music.
